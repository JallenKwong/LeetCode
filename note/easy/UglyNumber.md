Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

**Example 2**:

```
Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

**Example 3**:
```
Input: 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
```

**Note**:

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2³¹,  2³¹ − 1].
