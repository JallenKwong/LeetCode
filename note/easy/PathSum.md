## Description

[https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note**: A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example**:

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.
