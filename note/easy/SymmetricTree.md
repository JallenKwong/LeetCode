## Description

[https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

Follow up: Solve it both recursively and iteratively.



## Analysis

方法一：BFS

方法二：DFS（递归）
